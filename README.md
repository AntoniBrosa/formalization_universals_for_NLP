DESCRIPTION
----------

1. Dataset language: Not applicable



2. Abstract: The file contains all the formalisations that have been proposed in order to be able to carry out the checks of the doctoral thesis. The file is a script ordered by universal and where other more precise or alternative linguistic formalisations related to the analysed universal are also shown. The application of this script on the first 1000 treebanks of all the Universal Dependencies corpora (2.11) is what guides the results of the thesis.
